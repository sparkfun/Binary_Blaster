/******************************************************************************
Binary_Blaster.ino
Firmware for the Binary Blaster PTH Soldering Kit
Pete Lewis @ SparkFun Electronics
February 13th 2014
https://github.com/sparkfun/Binary_Blaster

This code is meant to be used with SFE's Binary Blaster thru-hole soldering kit. 
It can be found here: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12037
It is an educational kit that is meant to teach thru-hole soldering, 
and also challenge the player to practice binary conversion. The default playing
mode is to display the values in decimal. If you'd like to play hexadecimal 
mode, then you can do so by holding down the "bit0" button while powering up.

Resources:
No additional library requirements

Development environment specifics:
Arduino 1.0.5
Hardware: v10*
*Note, PB0 (aka arduino pin "D8") has been removed from the IC, to make it a
keyed part. This helps beginners avoid incorrect placement of the IC.

This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!

// HARDWARE PIN DECLARATIONS

// Define the anode (aka "+" or "high side") pins on the 7-segment displays
  // There are two 7-segment displays on this game.
  // We control each display by both writing the anode digit pin HIGH,
  // and writing the desired single segment cathode pin LOW. Only one segment 
  // may be actually lit at one instance. We blink segments in a fast 
  // sequence, and then it appears to illuminate multiple segments 
  // simultaneously. 
  // ***Note, the cathodes for the 7 segments are all connected
  // to the pins on PORTB. These are controlled by writing directly to the
  // entire port (e. g. "PORTB = ~0b00001100;") in function set_7segment_pins().
const int digit_1_anode = A5;
const int digit_2_anode = A4;

// Define pins connected to the switches inside the tactile LED buttons
  // Note, the tactile buttons have switches and LEDs inside them.
  // These pin definitions are for the switches. They will be set as inputs,
  // and used to know if the player is pressing the button down.
  // Each button corresponds to a bit, and therefore has the "bit0" or
  // "bit1" in it's name. This helps keep the player's input more
  // understandable. This pins are read in the function, read_buttons().
const int button_input_pin_bit0 = A3;
const int button_input_pin_bit1 = A2;
const int button_input_pin_bit2 = A1;
const int button_input_pin_bit3 = A0;

// Define pins connected to the LEDs inside the tactile LED buttons
  // Note, These pin definitions are for the LEDs, not the switches.
  // These are used to control the LEDs. If the user presses the correct
  // binary equivalent, then they will light up to show which bits have been
  // set. Turning an LED on means that bit is set. Turning an LED off means
  // that bit is cleared. When the game is waiting for the player to "blast
  // in" the correct bits, all bits are set as cleared.
  // Each LED corresponds to a bit, and therefore has the "bit0" or
  // "bit1" in it's name.
  // These pins are controlled in functions, display_leds() and
  // display_zoom().

// GAMEPLAY VARIABLE DECLARATIONS

// Define an array to store the sequence of values the player must repeat
  // This will include 16 possibilities, although we will not use "0",
  // because "0" is hard for the player to input. All other values will 
  // require the player to set bits (aka press the buttons) to create
  // the correct binary 4 bit equivalent.
  // This array will be filled in each time we call shuffle_sequence()
int sequence[16];

// Define a variable to store a time stamp of when we start each game
  // This will be used to calculate the total time it takes the player
  // to complete all 15 possibilities (this is how they win the game). 
  // Note, there is a timeout feature that will cause the player to loose
  // if they do not input the correct buttons within the timeout time.
  // This also resets the game and will require the player to do all 15 again
  // before they can win.
  // At the end of the game, it will display the total time that it took the
  // player to complete all 15. This is their "score" for that completion.
  // This way, the player can know how fast they were able to convert, 
  // and practice to decrease their total time.
long start_timestamp;

// Define the amount of time it takes to timeout during game-play
  // Each time a new value is displayed on the 7-segment displays, the player
  // only has a set amount of time to press the correct buttons. If they think
  // or wait too long, then the game will timeout and reset. This makes the 
  // game a bit more challenging and requires that the player really know
  // their conversions. By default is is set to 1000 milliseconds 
  // (aka 1 second). You can decrease this number to make it more difficult,
  // or make it longer if you'd like to have more time to practice.
  // This variable is used in function, listen_for_value().
#define TIMEOUT_MILISECONDS 50000

// Define a variable to display in hexadecimal or decimal
  // If this is set to true, then it will display in hex.
  // If false, then it will display in decimal.
  // This is checked in the function, display_7seg(), which ultimately changes
  // the display segments in set_7segment_pins().
